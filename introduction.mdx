client = SmartyPants(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

def publish_doc(content):

    print(f"Published: {result.id}")

## Brand Guidelines

<Expandable title="Brand Color and Usage" default-open="true">
  Use `#f90c84` as your primary accent color for buttons, links, and highlights. Pair it with neutrals for readability.

  ```css
  :root {
    --sp-primary: #f90c84;
    --sp-primary-hover: #e20b7a;
  }

  .button {
    background: var(--sp-primary);
    color: white;
  }
  ```

  Avoid using the color for text on light backgrounds—ensure contrast ratios meet WCAG standards.
