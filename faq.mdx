## How do I optimize MDX performance?

Minimize nested components and use lazy loading for images. Avoid deep nesting in `Tabs` or `Steps`.

<CodeGroup tabs="JavaScript,TypeScript">
  ```javascript
  // Optimized image with lazy loading
  import Image from './components/Image';

  <Image
    src="https://example.com/large-image.jpg"
    alt="Documentation screenshot"
    width={800}
    height={600}
    loading="lazy"
  />
  ```
  ```typescript
  // Type-safe component usage
  interface ImageProps {
    src: string;
    alt: string;
    width: number;
    height: number;
  }

  const OptimizedImage: React.FC<ImageProps> = ({ src, alt, width, height }) => (
    <Image src={src} alt={alt} width={width} height={height} loading="lazy" />
  );
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## What's the best folder structure for docs?

Organize as `/docs/intro.mdx`, `/docs/api.mdx`. Use frontmatter consistently.

<Columns cols={2}>
  <Card title="Version Control" icon="git-branch" href="#">
    Commit docs with CI/CD for automatic deploys.
  </Card>
  <Card title="SEO Tips" icon="search" href="#">
    Add meta descriptions in frontmatter for better search rankings.
  </Card>
</Columns>
